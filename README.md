# CVHistorical, reading historical documents with computer vision techniques in an OOP environment. 
- The purpose of this project is to build an optical character recognition (OCR) tool that automatically extract informaiton from 10,000+ pages of historical materials in the format of table. Commerical software does not work well on many historical which are very often oddly structured. I work with existing opensource packages to build up my own solution.
- The techqniues that are relevant to this project: Machine Vision, NLP, LSTM. 

1. Customize page, table and character segmentation using computer vision techinques. 
2. Optical Character Recognition (use synthetic data to enhance LSTM performance in OCR)
3. Post process (use NLP techniques to enhance output accuracy. Restrict results to dictionary)
