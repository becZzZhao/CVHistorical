### Mapped Data

### Introduction
Historians who found large “gold mines” of datasets might have all experienced the pain of digitizing them. This paper presents a solution for digitizing large historical datasets by combing, enhancing, and developing on open-source AI and machine vision tools. The example used in this paper is the Nineteenth-Century Official Registers of the United States which contains millions of employee information throughout the century in tabular format. This is a challenging example because the tables have poor structures and noisy backgrounds that cannot be handled by commercial OCR software. While this paper focuses on the implementation of the technique on historical tables, it also has broader implication for historians who wants to tailor their OCR tools for any type of non-typically structured historical documents. All software used in this paper is open-source and free.
